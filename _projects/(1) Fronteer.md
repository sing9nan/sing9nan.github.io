Fronteer is a highly modularized Remotely Operated underwater Vehicle(ROV) developed with <a href="https://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/~rovteam/">CityU Underwater Robotics Team</a>. It is designed to complete tasks in the MATE ROV competition. It equips with eight Blue Robotics T-200 thrusters in a vectored configuration to achieve 6-DoF movement. 

Electronics:\
The electronics are housed in a sealed tube and utilize a backplane design, allowing quick swaps of different subsystems. For communication, powerline communication (PLC) was used to connect the ROV to the ground control station through ROS over Ethernet.

Mechanical:\
Fronteer has a detachable frame, and depending on the task, different manipulators can be mounted on the extended frame. A pneumatic actuation system was chosen to drive the manipulators due to its ease of maintenance compared to electric-drive manipulators.
