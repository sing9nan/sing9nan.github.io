<img src='/images/robots/fronteer.jpg' width="500">
Fronteer is a highly modularized Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicle (ROV) developed with <a href="https://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/~rovteam/">CityU Underwater Robotics Team</a>. It is designed to complete tasks in the MATE ROV competition. It is equipped with eight Blue Robotics T-200 thrusters in a vectored configuration to achieve 6-DoF movement. 

__Electronics:__\
The electronics are housed in a sealed tube and utilize a backplane design, allowing quick swaps of different subsystems. For communication, powerline communication (PLC) was used to connect the ROV to the ground control station through ROS over Ethernet.

__Mechanical:__\
Fronteer features a detachable frame, and depending on the task, different manipulators can be mounted on the extended frame. A pneumatic actuation system was selected to drive the manipulators offering easier maintenance compared to electrically driven alternatives.
