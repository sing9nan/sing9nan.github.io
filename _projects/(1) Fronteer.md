# Fronteer

Fronteer is a highly modularized Remotely Operated underwater Vehicle(ROV) developed with <a href="https://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/~rovteam/">CityU Underwater Robotics Team</a>

Fronteer is designed to complete tasks in the MATE ROV competition. It equips with eight Blue Robotics T-200 thrusters in a vectored configuration to achieve 6-DoF movement. The electronics are housed in a sealed tube and utilize a backplane design, allowing quick swaps of different subsystems. Depending on the task, different manipulators can be mounted on the extended frame.\
