# Open Underwater Research System
<img src="/images/robots/sthing.jpg" width="300">\
This was a start-up project with my former teammates from the CityU Underwater Robotics Team, aiming to develop an autonomous underwater device for open-sea water column exploration. The underwater device employed a morphing structure to control depth, which was much more power-efficient compared to propulsion-based methods for depth control. It was also equipped with four thrusters to assist positioning, and a PID-based controller was implemented to regulate its depth and position.

Awards:\
