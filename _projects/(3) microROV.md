Micro ROV was designed to complete [drian pipe inspection](https://youtu.be/74NfNVIC7gQ?si=ROAnxh4pmuXip2_a&t=71) task in [2019 MATE ROV](https://materovcompetition.org/2019-competition-archive). It is equipped with two 25w thrusters, LEDs and an analog camera. The Micro ROV is tethered to the main ROV for power supply and command and video transmission. The embedded system integrated a STM32 MCU, motor drivers, power converter and RS485 communication circuit on one single PCB board (\< 4cm x 4cm).
