# CNN model for handwritten digits classification


In this project, I followed a [Handwritten Digit Recognition tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/code/itsmohammadshahid/7-cnn-handwritten-digit-recognition) on Kaggle to implement CNN model. The training data are from MNIST digits classification datasets from Keras.

I used the Adam optimizer to train the model and experimented with modifying hyperparameters, including increasing the number of convolutional layers, adjusting kernel sizes, and adding dropout layers. From these experiments, I observed that preventing overfitting is crucial, as models with more convolutional layers and larger kernels did not always achieve the best performance.

Through this project, I have a better understanding toward CNN, including how the convolutional layers extract features and how to fine-tune hyperparameters to improve model performance.
