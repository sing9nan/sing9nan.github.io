# **About Me**

Welcome! I am a robotics engineer at [ePropulsion](https://www.epropulsion.com/), working on Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS) features for surface vessels. My primary focus is on perception algorithms and system integration. I have developed sensor fusion algorithms to estimate pose for achieving ADAS Level 1 features in marine environments.

I earned my BEng in Computer and Data Engineering from [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/en). During my studies, I focused on underwater vehicle development, particularly in robotics perception and embedded systems design. I have also participated in [MATE ROV](https://materovcompetition.org/) and [SAUVC](https://sauvc.org/) competitions with [CityU Underwater Robotics Team](https://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/~rovteam/).
