# **About Me**

Welcome! I am a Robotics Engineer interested in localization, machine perception, and autonomous reasoning, aiming to build systems that navigate intelligently and safely in the real world.

I am currently working at [ePropulsion](https://www.epropulsion.com/), developing Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS) for surface vessels. My primary focus is on localization algorithms and system integration. I have developed multi-sensor fusion systems for robust state estimation to support marine ADAS Level 1 features.

I have been passionate about robotics since the beginning of high school and continued through my BEng in [Computer and Data Engineering](https://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/) from City University of Hong Kong. I participated in [MATE ROV](https://materovcompetition.org/) and [SAUVC](https://sauvc.org/) competitions as part of the [CityU Underwater Robotics Team](https://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/~rovteam/), focusing on underwater state estimation and embedded system design.
