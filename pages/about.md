# **About Me**

Welcome! I am a robotics engineer at [ePropulsion](https://www.epropulsion.com/), working on Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS) features for surface vessels. My primary focus is on localization algorithms and system integration. I have developed sensor fusion systems to estimate vessel pose and support ADAS Level 1 features in marine environments. 

I have been passionate about robotics since the beginning of high school. I earned my BEng in Computer and Data Engineering from [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/en), focusing on underwater vehicle development, particularly in robotics perception and embedded systems design. During my studies, I participated in [MATE ROV](https://materovcompetition.org/) and [SAUVC](https://sauvc.org/) competitions as part of the [CityU Underwater Robotics Team](https://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/~rovteam/).
