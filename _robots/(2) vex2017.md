description: A robot built for the VEX 2017 Robotics Competition. We designed a large grabber capable of picking up stars and cubes with an elevator mechanism that delivered them over a 0.5 m fence into the opponent’s zone. We also implemented an autonomous script to score points during the autonomous section.
